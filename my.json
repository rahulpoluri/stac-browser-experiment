   "description": "[GOES](https://www.goes.noaa.gov) satellites are geostationary weather satellites run by NOAA.\n\n\nThe Cloud and Moisture Imagery products are all at 2km\nresolution. Bands 1-6 are reflective. The dimensionless \"reflectance factor\" quantity is\nnormalized by the solar zenith angle. These bands support the characterization of clouds,\nvegetation, snow/ice, and aerosols. Bands 7-16 are emissive. The brightness temperature at the\nTop-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) is measured in Kelvin. These bands support the characterization of the\nsurface, clouds, water vapor, ozone, volcanic ash, and dust based on emissive properties.\n\n[README](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/satellite-data/goes-r-series-satellites#CMIP)\n",
